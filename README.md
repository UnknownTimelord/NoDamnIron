The mod for when you have no damn iron, but plenty of copper.

Features:
* Copper Toolset
* Copper Armorset

Installation:
* Install latest Fabric here: https://fabricmc.net/
* Place mod jar file in `.minecraft/mods/` (create mods folder if it does not exist), from releases (the jar that doesn't have `sources` at the end)

I probably won't update this since this is a planned vanilla feature. 

The Copper Armor textures were created by me since I could not find them. If Minecraft hasn't released these features and you find them, please create an issue and link them and I will create a second release containing them.

Enjoy!
